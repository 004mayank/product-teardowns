# Product Teardowns

Real-world product teardowns written from a Product Manager’s lens.

This repository contains structured analyses of popular digital products,
focused on **decision-making, metrics, and trade-offs**, not just UI critique.

## What these teardowns cover
- User problems and core personas
- End-to-end user journeys
- North Star and supporting metrics
- Funnel drop-offs and risks
- Product trade-offs and constraints
- What I would prioritize as a PM (30–60–90 day view)

## Why this repository exists
As a Product Manager, I use teardowns to:
- Practice structured product thinking
- Improve clarity around metrics and impact
- Analyze real-world constraints at scale
- Document how I reason about product decisions

## Teardowns
- Zomato – Search to Checkout Funnel *(in progress)*
- Loveable – AI agent builder *(in progress)*

More teardowns will be added iteratively to this repo.
